        <h2>Speedy Spaghetti</h2>
        <p>If your tired of the traditional spaghetti noodles with sauce poured over, give this one a try. This is the only way my family will eat their spaghetti.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground beef </li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>½ pinch dried basil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>4 ounces uncooked spaghetti</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the onion until all pink is gone; drain.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce, water, salt, parsley, basil and pepper; mix well. Heat until sauce boils. Break spaghetti in half and drop into sauce a little at a time. Cover and turn to low.</li>
            <li>ook until spaghetti is tender, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking to pan and from noodles sticking together. Add water, 1/2 to 1 cup, if it starts to dry out and noodles are not cooked.</li>
        </ol>
